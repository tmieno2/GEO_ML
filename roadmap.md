# Roadmap

## 12/26/2021

### Actions
+ **1_geom_ml_simulation.R** was created
  + GWR (Trevisan)
  + GWR-zone based SCAM 
  + semi-parametric GWR
  + DR-OF 
  + DR-OF with spatial smoothing of estimated coefficients

### Notes
+ the range of experimental rates have significant impacts on the relative performance of the methods listed above 
  
## 12/26/2021
+ **A1_test_of_DML_OF_c_analysis.rmd** was created
  + continuous treatment variables are split into splines 
  + DML-OF is used to estimate the heterogeneous impacts 
  + confirmed the code works!
## 12/31/2021
+ tested **DML_OF_c**
